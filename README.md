# System Notes

This is a collection of notes I took on how to do certain tasks with Linux. The notes are mostly stuff I cannot memorize and had to look up repeatedly in the past.

The notes are first and foremost written for myself, so some of them may not be of general interest. I am using Void Linux and prefer to use minimal software, so not every solution might be optimal for you.
